# wxWidget_HelloWorld

Here you will find the sample Hello World cpp file for a wxWidgets application. This code is copied from the following URL, I do not own this code, I simply have it here for personal reference:

https://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/overview_helloworld.html

This hello world example is to replace the pukey Win App default code that arises when starting a Windows Desktop Application in VS Studio. Be sure to follow the instructions on my blog post here (you're mileage may vary based on the version combinations you're configuring with).

Windows binaries can be downloaded here:
